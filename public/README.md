<!-- <small>🌱 I'm currently learning Rust.</small>
 [![avatar](avatar.png)](https://github.com/zyjared/ "github link") -->

> I obtained a bachelor's degree in Management and self-taught JavaScript, Typescript, Python, C, and Java during my university years. After graduation, I started my career as a management trainee and later transitioned into front-end development. Currently, I am focused on expanding my expertise in front-end technologies and Rust. My objective is to enhance my academic qualifications and broaden my professional horizons.
